Welcome to SeDuMi 1.1

SeDuMi 1.1 Installation instructions

The installation procedure of SeDuMi has changed since version 1.05R5
to facilitate platform independent installation. SeDuMi is written in Matlab,
with some time-critical procedures in C. These C files have to be compiled
into libraries. We provide generic (not highly optimized) binaries for
Windows, but on the other platforms you need to build the binaries. Also, if
performance is critical for your application, you are advised to recompile the
binaries in Windows as well.

0) Supported platforms and Matlab versions
SeDuMi has been tested on a wide variety of systems and compilers:

Matlab 7.0.4 64 bit, SuSe Linux 9.2 Pro on AMD Athlon 64, GCC
Matlab 7.0.4, Windows XP Pro, Intel Pentium 4, MSVC and lcc
Matlab 6.5, Windows 98, Intel Pentium II, GCC
Matlab 6.5, AIX, IBM RS6000, both GCC and native
Matlab 6.5, Sun OS, both GCC and native
Matlab 6.5, Mandrake Linux 9.3, 4xIntel Pentium III, GCC
Matlab 6.5, Mac OS X 10.3.9, both gcc and native

I don't have access to Matlab 6.0, I am not sure if SeDuMi is still compatible with that.

1) Installation instructions WITHOUT building the binaries (Windows)

If you are using Windows you can simply uncompress the distribution and add the
path of this folder to the Matlab path so that you can run it from anywhere.
If you want to rebuild the binaries for your hardware you can follow the
instructions in the next section.
The DLL-files in this distribution were compiled using MINGW.

2) Installation instructions WITH building the binaries (all platforms)

2.1) After uncompressing the distribution in the folder of your choice lauch Matlab
and change the current folder to where you put all the files.

2.2) First of all make sure that you have a compiler installed in Matlab. if yes,
you can jump to 2.3).
If you are not sure then probably there is no compiler installed. To install a compiler type

    mex -setup

This script will search for available compilers and install them for you.
Matlab supports several commercial and free compilers, for a list of
compilers for the different architectures check
http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html

On Windows you can also use the free GCC compiler, see the instructions at
http://gnumex.sourceforge.net/

If performance is really very important for you then you can experiment tweaking
your compiler's optimization flags, see your compiler's documentation for this.

2.3) After installing the compiler enter the directory where you put the SeDuMi files
and type

    install_sedumi

This will build all the binary files and add the directory to the Matlab path. You are now
ready to use SeDuMi. You can start by typing
    help sedumi

or by reading the User Guides in the /doc directory. To make changes permanent save the
path in Matlab.

2.4) If you have any questions or comments you can share them at the forum at
http://sedumi.mcmaster.ca.
